This project is based on the creation of a linked list, though, in this case the list is traversed backwards and has the attribute of inmutability.
Time and Space complexity
As for the time complexity, being a linked list in its core structure, it has:

1. append: O(1)
2. size: O(n)

In respect to space complexity, it is directly dependant on the number of nodes our BlockChain incorporates, resulting in O(n).
